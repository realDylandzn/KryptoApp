# KryptoApp

That's a web 3.0 project that i'm doing following the step by step tutorial from Javascrip Mastery channel on Youtube. There's so much advance knowledge that i don't have learned yet, but i wanted to get my hands on some real project.

I'm learning a lot doing that, even if i am an amateur developer.

I'll continue to doing that project till i have finished it:)
